# Terragrunt Example

This folder contains the simplest possible Terragrunt moduleâ€”one that just passes inputs to terraform-to demonstrate how
you can use Terratest to write automated tests for your Terragrunt code.

Check out [test/terragrunt_example_test.go](/test/terragrunt_example_test.go) to see how you can
write automated tests for this simple module.

Note that this module doesn't do anything useful; it's just here to demonstrate the simplest usage pattern for
Terratest.
